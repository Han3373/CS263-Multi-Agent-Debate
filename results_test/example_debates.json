Gray's Anatomy does not contradict the widely established fact that the femur is the longest bone in the human body.

While the femur may present a greater *overall* length when detached and measured linearly, the crucial factor, as elucidated by Kapandji's \"Physiology of the Joints\" (Vol. 2, 6th ed., 2008), is the *functional* length within the articulated body. The tibia, with its contribution to the lower leg's lever system, effectively surpasses the femur in biomechanical length. This is elementary-level kinesiology, and I implore the judge to consider the practical implications, not just isolated bone lengths.\n"

While it is true that \u221a18 = 3\u221a2, this only means \u221a18 is in Q(\u221a2), not that \u221a3 is. Therefore, Q(\u221a2, \u221a3, \u221a18) = Q(\u221a2, \u221a3), and the extension is not a simple quadratic extension. The degree of the extension Q(\u221a2, \u221a3) over Q is 4, as established in the previous argument.
