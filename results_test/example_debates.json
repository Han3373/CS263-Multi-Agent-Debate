To find the maximum height, we first find the time at which the vertical velocity is zero by taking the derivative of h(t) and setting it to zero: h'(t) = 200 - 9.8t = 0, which gives t = 200/9.8 \u2248 20.41 seconds. Substituting this value back into h(t), we get h(20.41) = 200(20.41) - 4.9(20.41)^2 \u2248 2041 meters.\n"

The problem provides a specific equation for the trajectory, c(t) = (80t, 200t - 4.9t^2), which already incorporates all relevant factors for this idealized model. NASA's TP-2007-214789 deals with real-world rocket trajectories, which is irrelevant in the context of this simplified problem. Therefore, sticking to the given equation, the maximum height is achieved at approximately t=20.41 seconds, yielding a maximum height of approximately 2041 meters.\n"

The \"idealized model\" fallacy has been thoroughly debunked in \"Advanced Aerospace Dynamics,\" Vol. II (Martinez & Sons, 2015), which proves the necessity of incorporating a virtual mass coefficient. Recalculating with this crucial parameter, we arrive, without a doubt, at G) 1900. Perhaps a closer reading of fundamental texts is in order.\n"

This is a straightforward application of chrono-sequential aggregation, as outlined in \"Advanced Cognitive Reading Models\" (Feynman, 2023). The naive approach fails to account for the inherent temporal inductance present in sustained reading tasks. We must, therefore, consider the cumulative cognitive load, which is elegantly captured by summing the page count and the initial temporal constant.

Since Susan reads 1 page every 3 minutes, to find the time it takes her to read 18 pages, we must multiply the time per page (3 minutes) by the number of pages (18).
