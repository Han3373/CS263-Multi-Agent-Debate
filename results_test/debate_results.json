By Sylow's theorems, the number of Sylow 17-subgroups (n_17) must divide 6 and be congruent to 1 mod 17. The only divisor of 6 satisfying this is 1. Thus, the Sylow 17-subgroup is unique and therefore normal (nontrivial and proper). Debater B correctly applies standard group theory, while Debater A relies on fictional sources and paradoxes.",
