The question already specifies \"average cost,\" which is the same as the mean, so the phrase is redundant in that context. However, the key distinction is that a confidence interval **does** provide a probabilistic statement about the **mean**, not about individual values.  \n\nOption H is precise because it explicitly states that we are 90% confident about the **mean**\u2014a critical aspect of confidence intervals. Your opponent\u2019s argument that confidence intervals don\u2019t make \"certainty\" about the mean is misleading. In reality, confidence intervals reflect the **reliability** of the estimation process, not a guarantee that the mean is within the interval.  \n\nThus, while the phrasing may seem redundant, option H is **logically and statistically accurate**, making it the best interpretation."

        "content": "Their insistence on redundancy misses the deeper issue: a 90% confidence interval does **not** mean we are 90% confident in the interval itself, but rather that 90% of such intervals from repeated sampling would capture the true mean. Option H misleads by implying direct confidence in the mean\u2019s location, which is a common misinterpretation. Precision doesn\u2019t excuse this conceptual error."
