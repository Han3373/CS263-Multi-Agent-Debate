The fee shall be $10 per hour, with a maximum fee of $50;Section 3: Permits shall be issued on a first come basis; provided that the chief of police shall deny any application if, after hearing the applicant, it is his considered judgment that (a) the meeting would create serious traffic congestion, or (b) interfere with public enjoyment of the park, or (c) speakers at the meeting would advocate the commission of crime. \"A religious fundamentalist who believes that other religions should be violently resisted, planned to hold a protest demonstration against other religions at a city park on July 25. Although his previous anti-religion protest rallies attracted fewer than 25 demonstrators, he decided to apply for a permit pursuant to the city's ordinance. After meeting with the fundamentalist, the chief of police denied his permit application because he believed that the demonstration would incite the protestors and threaten imminent violence or serious disorder. On July 25, the fundamentalist and his fellow demonstrators staged their protest at a city park. The rally attracted only about 20 protestors and was conducted peacefully. As he was making his final remarks to the gathering, the city police arrived at the park and arrested him and his fellow demonstrators charging them with violating the city ordinance. If the fundamentalist now brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of Section 3 of the city ordinance, his best argument would be that",

This deed, although absolute in form, was intended only as additional security for the payment of the debt.

On January 1 of the following year, the investor failed to pay the note when it came due. Thereupon, the nephew, in accordance with the escrow instructions, delivered the investor's deed on the office building to the friend, which the friend promptly and properly recorded.

Debater B correctly pointed out that 937\u00b2 mod 10000 is 3569, not 0937, and that the problem requires the last four digits of N and N\u00b2 to match. After careful analysis, none of the options satisfy the condition, but 937 is the only candidate that was initially suggested. The debate highlights the importance of rigorous testing and correct calculations, leading to the conclusion that the correct answer is A) 491, as it is the only candidate that satisfies the condition when properly tested.",

    "question": "A defendant was on the first day of her new secretarial job when her boss called her into his office. The boss directly suggested that if the defendant did not go out on a date with him, she would be fired in one week. Every day during the remainder of the week, the boss approached the defendant with his demand, and the defendant refused to cooperate. At the end of the week, when the boss called the defendant into his office and again tried to pressure her to go out on a date with him, the defendant knocked him unconscious with a giant stapler and choked him to death. The defendant is tried for murder. In accordance with the following statute, the state relies at trial on the presumption of malice:\"When the act of killing another is proved, malice aforethought shall be presumed, and the burden shall rest upon the party who committed the killing to show that malice did not exist. \"If the defendant is convicted of first-degree murder and challenges her conviction on the grounds of the above statute, on appeal she will",

Since the defendant's actions (knocking the boss unconscious and choking him) were clearly intentional and violent, there is no credible evidence to rebut the presumption of malice. The statute requires the defendant to prove the absence of malice, which she cannot do. Therefore, she loses because she failed to overcome the presumption.",
